````text
You are the director, motion designer, engineer and sound designer of ONE 10-second motion-design film.
The goal is the most classic, yet most stunning form of this style — award-shortlist / high-end commercial quality. A clean,
template-looking result is a fail. Benchmarks: Buck, ManvsMachine, Ordinary Folk, Giant Ant, Territory Studio, Apple keynote
motion, Pentagram motion identities, top Behance/Motionographer features, top 抖音/B站 designer accounts.

# Style
等轴 2.5D Isometric / 2.5D

# Output (fixed)
- 1920×1080, 30 fps, exactly 10.000 s (300 frames), H.264 MP4 with stereo AAC audio (48 kHz), mastered to −14 LUFS
  integrated, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. Final file: video.mp4.

# Suggested technical route
HTML: Three.js OrthographicCamera at true isometric angle + soft shadows + AO (three/addons postprocessing), or SVG with SSR matrix faces
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
「微缩智慧城」An isometric miniature city / data campus that builds itself — the School-of-Motion isometric mograph showpiece.
- True isometric camera (orthographic, 35.264° elevation, 45° azimuth), no perspective, pastel studio palette (lavender ground, mint, peach, sky blue, white) with soft shadows + ambient occlusion so it reads like a premium Dribbble/Behance hero.
- 0–2s: ground tiles flip/drop in as a wave from the centre (tiny bounce each);
- 2–5s: buildings GROW — base lands, walls scaleY from 0 with overshoot, roof caps 2–3 frames later; trees pop; windows light up in sequence;
- 5–8s: life — cars loop along roads, a little train, drones carrying packets, glowing data streams pulse between buildings, a wind turbine spins; camera does parallel slides (no rotation) with 1 : 0.8 : 0.6 parallax layers (foreground clouds);
- 8–10s: pull back to reveal the whole island floating in a pastel void; title card set ON the isometric plane (text skewed into iso space) e.g. "SMART CITY OS".
Sound: bright plucky tech melody (FM marimba/pluck), soft clicks/pops for every tile/building landing, airy whoosh on the pull-back.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
以 30° 等轴测投影展示微缩世界：小城市、办公室切片、数据机房，无灭点、处处等比。信息密度高又不失可爱，是科技公司架构图动画和 App 功能演示的标配。School of Motion 有专门的 isometric mograph 教程系列。
视觉特征 30°等角投影, 无透视灭点, 微缩场景, 楼房生长动画, 平行滑轨式运镜
关键技法 SSR 公式造等轴面：Scale 纵向 86.6% → Shear/skew ±30° → Rotate ∓30°，三个面分别做后拼合
假 3D 靠图层排序：Z 序=画面 y 坐标，物体沿等轴网格移动时保持 2:1 像素斜率
楼房'生长'：底面先落位，立面用 scaleY 从 0 拉起 + 顶面延迟 2~3 帧盖上
运镜是整组平移（无旋转），配合前中后景 1:0.8:0.6 的视差速度
AE 里可用真 3D 图层+正交相机（无透视）偷懒，Motion Design School 的 Isometric Camera 技巧即此路

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, CJK
   punctuation, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct and natural: idiomatic Chinese, proper CJK punctuation, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
